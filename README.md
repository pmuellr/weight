weight charts for nerds
=======================

Check out the demo by running a webserver in this directory:

    npx serve

It will display the UX available via the root directory.

The data displayed is obtained from `weight.csv`, which is `.gitignore`d
in this project.  The app will look for demo data in lieu of `weight.csv`,
in the `weight-demo.csv` file.

So, **your weight data is private**.
But also, **it's not backed up if you clone this repo**.
You know what to do ... (but don't ask me!)
